# Web-Based Visualisation System for Divvy Data Analysis

## 🗒️ Sketches

Sketches can be found in the `sketches/` folder.

Concept is to have several _modes_ of plots. A rough draft is shown in [V3](sketches/webpage-design-v03.png).

Propose to have three modes: brush mode, slider mode and a third one TBD. The first two are Project 2 plots/adaptations.

_Brush mode_ concept is shown in [V4](sketches/webpage-design-v04.png). Minimalist, straight-to-the-point and easy to use is the intention.

## 💼 Portofolio Notes

This project was done under a duration of 3 weeks, presented on _TBD_. This is the final version/continuation of previous projects. For this class (CS 424), we did two projects already: [Project 1](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-1-raka-s-team) (September 2022) and [Project 2](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-2-raka-s-team) (October 2022).

_Note: both project repositories are private._

In both previous projects, plus this one, we are analysing data from _Divvy_, a bikeshare service in Chicago, IL, USA.

In Project 1, we practiced simple visualisations using Python. In Project 2, we familiarised ourselves with interactive visualisations using JavaScript and D3 on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). In this final project, we are making a full website that hosts all of our previous visualisations, plus some new ones.
