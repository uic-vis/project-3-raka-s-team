# Web-Based Visualisation System for Divvy Data Analysis

## 🗒️ Sketches

I guess our first task is to figure out an ideal layout for our web page. Two basic concepts I thought of, but happy to deviate from.

**V1**. Condense our Project 2 plots such that all viewable without scrolling, somehow.

**V2**. Tell a story about the plots, from top to bottom, showcasing all plots with scrolling.

**V3**. Interface based on "modes", where the map/slider/drop-down gets enabled/disabled depending on the mode.

We are using _<insert here>_ to host our web page.

## 💼 Portofolio Notes

This project was done under a duration of 3 weeks, presented on _TBD_. This is the final version/continuation of previous projects. For this class (CS 424), we did two projects already: [Project 1](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-1-raka-s-team) (September 2022) and [Project 2](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-2-raka-s-team) (October 2022).

_Note: both project repositories are private._

In both previous projects, plus this one, we are analysing data from _Divvy_, a bikeshare service in Chicago, IL, USA.

In Project 1, we practiced simple visualisations using Python. In Project 2, we familiarised ourselves with interactive visualisations using JavaScript and D3 on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). In this final project, we are making a full website that hosts all of our previous visualisations, plus some new ones.
