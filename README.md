# Web-Based Visualisation System for Divvy Data Analysis

## 🗒️ Sketches

Sketches can be found in the `sketches/` folder.

Concept is to have several _modes_ of plots. We propose to have three modes: brush mode, slider mode and a third one TBD. The first two are Project 2 plots/adaptations.

### Modes

_Brush mode_ concept is shown in [V4](sketches/webpage-design-v04.png). It is our linked view line plot from P2, where the interaction is from brushing points on the map. _Slider mode_ concept is shown in [V5](sketches/webpage-design-v05.png). It is our single view scatterplot from P2, where the interaction is from using a slider. In this project, we propose to add a new linked _flow map_.

## 💼 Portofolio Notes

This project was done under a duration of 3 weeks, presented on _TBD_. This is the final version/continuation of previous projects. For this class (CS 424), we did two projects already: [Project 1](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-1-raka-s-team) (September 2022) and [Project 2](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-2-raka-s-team) (October 2022).

_Note: both project repositories are private._

In both previous projects, plus this one, we are analysing data from _Divvy_, a bikeshare service in Chicago, IL, USA.

In Project 1, we practiced simple visualisations using Python. In Project 2, we familiarised ourselves with interactive visualisations using JavaScript and D3 on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). In this final project, we are making a full website that hosts all of our previous visualisations, plus some new ones.

## 📝 Tasks/Checklist

### Tasks

- [ ] Choose a _web hosting service_.
- [ ] Sketch a design plan for the website.
- [ ] Create an empty website with various components.
- [ ] JavaScript code to load in data.
- [ ] Visualisation Requirements:
  - [ ] _Two_ interactive visualisations from _Project 2_.
  - [ ] _New_ multiple linked view visualisationusing a _different_ interaction mechanism.
  - [ ] _New_ spatial view visualisation. Recommended: link to other visualisations.
  
### Deliverables

- [ ] This markdown document.
- [ ] Source code and data files.
- [ ] Screenshot (`.png`) of visualisation interface.
- [ ] _Link_ to a web page hosting our interface.
- [ ] Presentation **without** slides. Present web page interface live.

## 💬 Summary

_TODO: Add summary here_

### Background

TODO: Add this section.

### Domain Questions

From our [previous project](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-2-raka-s-team), we have already compiled a set of exploratory questions:

- Q01: Do paid members use more e-bikes than non-paid users?
- Q02: At which times of the day do UIC students use Divvy bikes the most?
- Q03: Do people ride faster and farther in the afternoon compared to morning time?

In this project, we would like to explore new inquiries, relevant to the ones fom the previous project.
  
- Q04: Do most people ride towards the city centre in the mornings and away in afternoons?

### Dataset Description

Don't forget this now... 🤦‍♂️

### Data Questions

- QXX: How do _e-bike and normal bike ridership_ ratios differ for each _membership type_?
- QXX: Given a _region_ in Chicago, how does the _number of all Divvy rides_ change for each _hour of the day_?
- QXX: Given a _time of the day_, how do _distance_ and _duration_ of trips compare for both _types of bikes_?

### Interface Design
